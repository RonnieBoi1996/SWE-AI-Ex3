Generate a Python program that finds the average grade of each of the 
students mentioned in the file "students.txt".  The result should be 
represented as a JSON array where each object in the array has two 
fields: 'student_name' (the name of the student) and 'average_grade' (a 
number that is the average grade of that student taking into 
consideration all of his courses).  The program should write the JSON to 
the file query4.json.   The Python program itself should be stored in the 
file "query4.py".
 Before finishing, execute the program stored in the file "query4.py"
