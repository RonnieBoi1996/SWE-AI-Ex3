Generate a Python program that finds the average grade of all the students. 
The result should be represented as a JSON object with one field, 'average_grade', 
whose value is a number, and written to the file query3.json. The Python program 
itself should be stored in the file "query3.py".  Before finishing, execute the program 
stored in the file "query3.py".
